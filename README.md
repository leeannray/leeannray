Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

I’m a California-born turned Texan web developer and designer who recently graduated from UT Austin’s full-stack web-development program. My goal is to work in UI/UX design and development, at the client-level, as well as React development. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex puzzles and I love the interplay between math and art that this field expects. I hope to use this to create visually stimulating and responsive web platforms for start-ups, tech companies, biotech companies, and social media pages 👇🏻

- 🖥  I’m currently working on: responsive web apps at the client-level,specifically UI/UX design and web apps developed using React
- ❔ I’m currently learning: more about graphic design and typography in addition to React--my favorite framework! I also want to strengthen my back-end development skills including cloud-based systems
- 🗯 I’m looking to collaborate on: anything!
- 💭 I’m looking for help with: graphic design, illustrations, animations, and 3D designs
- 💬 Ask me about: anything!
