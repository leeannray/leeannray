### Hi there, I'm Lee Ann ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**leeannray/leeannray** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

Iâ€™m a California-born turned Texan web developer and designer who recently graduated from UT Austinâ€™s full-stack web-development program. My goal is to work in UI/UX design and development, at the client-level, as well as React development. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex puzzles and I love the interplay between math and art that this field expects. I hope to use this to create visually stimulating and responsive web platforms for start-ups, tech companies, biotech companies, and social media pages.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: user-friendly, responsive, web apps focused on UI/UX design and development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: more about graphic design and typography in addition to React--my favorite framework!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: anything!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: graphic design, illustrations, animations, and 3D designs
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: anything!
