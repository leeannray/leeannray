Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

Iâ€™m a California-born turned Texan web developer and designer who recently graduated from UT Austinâ€™s full-stack web-development program. My goal is to work in UI/UX design and development, at the client-level, as well as React development. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex puzzles and I love the interplay between math and art that this field expects. I hope to use this to create visually stimulating and responsive web platforms for start-ups, tech companies, biotech companies, and social media pages.
